    <p>The <strong> HyperText Markup Language or HTML</strong> is <em>the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser</em>. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from <em>local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages</em>. <strong>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</strong></p>
