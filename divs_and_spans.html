    <h1>Divs and spans</h1>

    <div>
      <p>At the top of my page, I have a logical section, the "header". Since this is a section, I use a div (with an appropriate id). Within that, I have a couple of sections: the user bar and the actual page title. The title uses the appropriate tag, h1. The userbar, being a section, is wrapped in a div. Within that, the username is wrapped in a span, so that I can change the style. As you can see, I have also wrapped a span around 2 letters in the title - this allows me to change their color in my stylesheet.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p> <span>Section 4.4 of the HTML 5 working draft lists them and gives hints as to their usage.</span>
         HTML5 is still a working spec, so nothing is "final" yet, but it is highly
         doubtful that any of these elements are going anywhere. There is a javascript
         hack that you will need to use if you want to style these elements in some older
         version of IE - You need to create one of each element using
         document.createElement before any of those elements are specified in your 
         source. There are a bunch of libraries that will take care of this for you
         - a quick Google search turned up html5shiv.</p>
